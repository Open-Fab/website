Let anyone make anything.
</h1>
<p>
Open Fab began with a vision to create a fully open source maker space in Melbourne. 
</p>

<p>
Since then OpenFab has expanded and become a research and development hub that supports, connects and enables researchers, inventors and makers across Melbourne and beyond. We now use open source software and hardware almost exclusively. Our facilities and work space are open to anyone who is interested in testing and using the full potential of digital design and manufacture.
